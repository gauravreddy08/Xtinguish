## How can I test it?

Finally after training the model, I have exported it as `.hdf5` files and then integrated it with **Streamlit Web App**. 


### To view the Deployed app, [Click here](https://share.streamlit.io/gauravreddy08/xtinguish/main/app/app.py)

> The app may take a couple of seconds to load for the first time, but it works perfectly fine.

Once an app is loaded, 

1. Upload an image.

2. Once the image is processed, **`Predict`** button appears. Click it.

3. Once you click the **`Predict`** button, the model prediction takes place and the output will be displayed.

4. And voilÃ , there you go.
